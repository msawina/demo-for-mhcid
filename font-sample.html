    <p class= "lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
    <p class= "copy">At first you might think that Prof. Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing there. Upon reflection, however, it would become clear that the mentiones belied a deep set obsession with the odiforus bulb. Making many questions whether there was vampire trauma in his past. 
    </p>
    <p class= "addon">It was an obsession that would eventually lead to his demise.</p>
