    <p class= "lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
    <p class= "copy">At forst you might think that Prof. Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passign there. Upon refelection, however, it would become clear that the mentiones belied a deep set obsession with the odiforus bulb. Making many questions whether there was vamire trauma in his past.
